# BoiseWeb.Dev

Hey there Boise Web Dev party people! Add your name to this here Hall of ~~Shame~~ Fame!

## The ~~Destructions~~ Directions

### Adding your info

- Clone the repo
- Add your info to the json file at `components/peopleData.json`
- Required:
  - name: please use your legit name, nicknames and AKAs are welcome in the description though
  - description: 0-300 characters of descriptive awesomeness
  - image: we wanna see your smiling mug
- Optional:
  - links
    - icon: Choose an icon to represent your link from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2). Include in that value whatever should be inserted into the class parameter to make it work.
    - url: Should be pretty self explanatory. You did say you were a web dev, right?

### Add your photo

- Add a photo of your beautiful face to the `public/images` folder. 400px x 400px is optimal. Use the format `YourName.jpg` or `YourName.png` to keep things simple. Leave out apostrophe's or any other characters that will break stuff.

### Commit & Make A Pull Request

I'll ensure the format looks legit, and possibly ensure you exist on the Googles... then approve.

## Disclosure

It should go without saying... but... well...
This stuff is going on the internets and is public. I reserve the right to share what you put in here. If you don't want it out there, don't share it.

## What Is This?

It's just a little project I built to keep myself entertained. It's built on Next.js and deployed to Netlify. I'm open to suggestions for improvement... even _constructive_ criticism.
